# GoHighLevel Directory (WordPress plugin)

Pulls contacts out of a GoHighLevel (LeadConnector) sub-account and renders them
as a filterable directory on any page, via `[ghl_directory]`.

## Install

1. `./build-zip.sh` (or zip the `ghl-directory` directory yourself), then upload
   it under Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin, and activate.
2. In GoHighLevel, in the **sub-account** you want to list: Settings → Private
   Integrations → create a token with the `contacts.readonly` scope. Add
   `locations/customFields.readonly` too if you want custom fields (job title,
   headshot URL, …) available for mapping and filtering.
3. In WordPress: Settings → GHL Directory. Choose API v2, paste the token, enter
   the Location ID, **Save**, then **Sync now**.
4. Put `[ghl_directory]` on a page.

Legacy sub-accounts that still use a v1 API key (Settings → Business Info → API
Key) can pick "v1" instead; the key is already location-scoped so no Location ID
is needed.

### Keeping the token out of the database

```php
// wp-config.php
define( 'GHLD_API_TOKEN', 'pit-...' );
define( 'GHLD_LOCATION_ID', 'abc123...' );
```

When the constant is set the admin field is replaced with a note, and the token
never appears in a database dump or in the settings form.

## Shortcode

```
[ghl_directory]

[ghl_directory tags="directory" columns="4" per_page="36"
               filters="search,tag,city,sort"
               show="photo,title,company,location,tags"
               layout="grid" orderby="name" order="asc"]
```

| Attribute | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tags` | setting | Only list contacts carrying any of these GoHighLevel tags (added on top of the global include list). |
| `exclude_tags` | setting | Never list contacts carrying these tags. |
| `filters` | setting | Filter-bar controls: `search`, `tag`, `city`, `state`, `company`, `sort`, `cf:<field_key>`. `none` hides the bar. |
| `show` | setting | Card contents: `photo`, `title`, `company`, `location`, `tags`, `bio`, `email`, `phone`, `website`, `cf:<field_key>`. |
| `columns` | 3 | Grid columns on wide screens (1–6); narrower screens auto-fit. |
| `per_page` | 24 | Contacts per page (1–200). |
| `orderby` / `order` | `name` / `asc` | `name`, `company` or `date_added`; `asc` or `desc`. |
| `layout` | `grid` | `grid` or `list`. |
| `search` | — | A search term always applied to this directory, on top of whatever a visitor types. |
| `empty` | — | Message shown when nothing matches. |

Custom field keys come from GoHighLevel's `fieldKey` with the `contact.` prefix
stripped — `contact.job_title` is used as `cf:job_title`. The Settings screen
lists the discovered fields by name after the first sync.

## How it fits together

- **Sync.** `GHLD_Repository::sync()` pulls every contact through the paginated
  `/contacts/` endpoint, normalizes each one (`GHLD_Contact`), and stores the set
  in the non-autoloaded `ghld_contacts` option. WP-Cron re-runs it hourly; a page
  view triggers it when the cache is older than the configured lifetime.
- **Never blocks the page.** A failed sync is recorded and the previously cached
  set keeps rendering, with a 5-minute back-off before the next attempt. A
  partial API response is discarded rather than replacing a full directory.
- **Filtering.** Filtering, sorting, faceting and pagination all run in PHP over
  the cached array — no API call per request.
- **Filter bar.** The bar is a plain GET form that works with JavaScript off. With
  JavaScript on, `assets/js/ghl-directory.js` fetches
  `/wp-json/ghl-directory/v1/contacts` and swaps in server-rendered fragments, so
  cards have exactly one implementation (`templates/contact-card.php`).
- **Scope safety.** The REST endpoint doesn't accept tag arguments. Each rendered
  shortcode registers its resolved scope under an opaque instance key, and the
  endpoint only ever queries within the scope that key resolves to — a visitor
  can't widen a deliberately narrowed directory by editing the request.
- **Re-mapping is free.** Changing which field holds the photo/title/bio
  re-derives those values from the cached contacts; only credential changes force
  a re-fetch.

## Privacy

A GoHighLevel location is a CRM, so most of its contacts are not meant to be
public. The defaults are deliberately conservative:

- **Set "Only include tags"** (e.g. `directory`) and tag the people who agreed to
  be listed. With it empty, every synced contact is listable.
- Email and phone are **off** by default in the card settings.
- The Gravatar fallback is **off** by default, because it sends a hash of each
  listed contact's email address to gravatar.com.

## Customizing

Copy any file from `templates/` into `your-theme/ghl-directory/` to override it.
Styling is driven by custom properties on `.ghld-directory`
(`--ghld-columns`, `--ghld-gap`, `--ghld-radius`, `--ghld-border`,
`--ghld-surface`, `--ghld-muted`, `--ghld-avatar-size`), so a theme can restyle
the directory without fighting selectors.

Hooks:

| Hook | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ghld_normalize_contact` | filter | Adjust a contact after normalization, before caching. |
| `ghld_directory_scope` | filter | Adjust a shortcode's resolved scope. |
| `ghld_template_candidates` | filter | Change the template lookup order. |
| `ghld_after_sync` | action | Runs after a successful sync with the normalized set. |

## Tests

`tests/test_ghl_directory_plugin.py` in the repo root lints every PHP file and
checks the plugin's structural invariants (direct-access guards, version
consistency, escaped output in templates):

```
python3 -m pytest tests/test_ghl_directory_plugin.py
```
